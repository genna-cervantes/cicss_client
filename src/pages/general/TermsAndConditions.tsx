            Last Updated: March 28, 2025 Welcome to the Centralized Integrated
            Class Scheduler System (CICSS). By accessing or using this system,
            you agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms and
            conditions. If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use
            the system. 1. Definitions "System" refers to the CICSS platform.
            "User" refers to any individual who accesses the system, including
            department chairs, teaching academic staff, and students.
            "Administrator" refers to the department chair responsible for
            managing the scheduling process. "Data" refers to information
            entered into the system, including schedules, feedback, and reports.
            2. User Eligibility The system is available exclusively to students,
            teaching academic staff, and department chairs of the College of
            Information and Computing Sciences. Users must use their
            university-registered email addresses to access the system. 3. User
            Responsibilities 3.1. Account Security Users are responsible for
            maintaining the confidentiality of their login credentials.
            Unauthorized access or sharing of login details is strictly
            prohibited. 3.2. Accurate Information Users must ensure that all
            data entered into the system is accurate and up-to-date. Any
            intentional falsification of data may result in restricted access or
            disciplinary action. 3.3. Proper Use The system should only be used
            for academic scheduling purposes. Users must not engage in
            activities that disrupt system functionality, such as attempting to
            hack, alter, or manipulate schedules outside their role. 4.
            Scheduling Policies 4.1. Schedule Availability Schedules are
            generated based on room availability, faculty assignments, and
            university policies. Teaching academic staff and students must check
            their assigned schedules in the system. 4.2. Schedule Adjustments
            Once deployed, schedules cannot be changed until the next semester
            unless approved by the department chair. Requests for schedule
            modifications must be submitted through the designated process. 4.3.
            Sending Feedback on Scheduling Issues Users may send feedback
            regarding scheduling conflicts, such as overlapping classes or
            incorrect assignments, via the Send Feedback function. The
            department chair will review and address submitted feedback at their
            discretion. 5. Feedback and Ratings Teaching academic staff and
            students may provide feedback on assigned schedules through the
            Schedule Rating feature. Constructive feedback is encouraged to
            improve future scheduling processes. 6. Data Privacy and Security
            The system collects only email addresses for user identification
            purposes. No additional personal data is stored or shared with third
            parties. System administrators will take necessary measures to
            protect data integrity and security. 7. System Downtime and
            Maintenance Scheduled maintenance may cause temporary system
            unavailability. Users will be notified in advance of any planned
            maintenance. The university is not responsible for any inconvenience
            caused by unexpected system downtimes. 8. Violations and
            Consequences Any violation of these terms may result in temporary or
            permanent suspension of access to the system, disciplinary action as
            per university policies, or reporting of severe violations to
            university administration. 9. Limitation of Liability The university
            is not liable for any losses, damages, or inconveniences arising
            from system errors, incorrect scheduling, or misuse of the platform.
            Users acknowledge that the system is provided "as is" and may be
            subject to improvements or modifications. 10. Amendments to Terms
            These terms and conditions may be updated periodically. Users will
            be notified of any significant changes. Continued use of the system
            after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised terms. 11.
